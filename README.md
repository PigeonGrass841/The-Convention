# The-Convention

# Project Overview
The Convention is coming to town! It’s going to be grand, spectacular! And the promoters have chosen you to create the web page for it. Your job is to build something that people will love to read, with information about guests and events. The success of the Convention depends on you. If your page is beautiful, people will get excited and come. If not… well, let’s hope this isn’t your last job.

# Display
You need to create something that is going to be inviting to visitors of your page.
  * The Convention needs a splash page, something that will really draw in the visitors.
    - Show the highlights of the Convention.
    - Create a link to a guests page.
    - Create a link to an events page.
    - The content of the Convention is up to you. Choose something you like and build the Convention around that.
  * The Convention will need a guests page.
    - Each featured guest should have a large section near the top with a bio and times the guest will be speaking or meeting fans.
    - Secondary guests can be listed afterwards with a shorter bio and their booth numbers.
  * The Convention will need an events page.
    - Create a schedule of events for visitors to view.

# Functionality
Your page needs to be neatly organized and easy to navigate. Make sure that you have links to every page on every page. I want to be able to go to the guest and events page from the home page, the home and guest page from the events page and the home and events page from the guest page. The guest page should NOT display all of the information about a guest immediately. That information should be invisible and only become visible when the user selects to see it. Use CSS to show and hide different pieces of information. The events page should list all of the event titles and their times. The user should be able to click on an event and see a description become visible (like with the guest page).

# Enhancements
 1. Allow the user to register for events. When the user goes into the events page, they should see which events they have signed up for.
 2. Create a “Register” button for each event. When the user registers for an event, add the event’s name to a string of events the user has signed up for.
 3. Create an “Unregister For All Events” button that will wipe the string.
