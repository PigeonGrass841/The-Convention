        <p>"Umami was discovered in 1908 by Professor Kikunae Ikeda, a chemist at Tokyo Imperial University." (Kikkoman)</p>
        <p>"He noticed a particular 'savoury' taste in certain foods such as dashi, asparagus, cheese, tomatoes and meat that were neither sweet, sour, salty or bitter." (Kikkoman)</p>
        <p>"Having found that the Japanese stock dashi had the most pronounced savoury taste, he focused on kombu - the seaweed used to make dashi." (Kikkoman)</p>
        <p>"After conducting much research, Ikeda went on to identify glutamate, an amino acid, as the origin of this new savoury taste sensation and called it 'umami'." (Kikkoman)</p>
